* LEDs talk about LEDs (2019)

Here are the slides for the talk I gave about LEDs on the seventh
GrunnJS at Spindle.

The [[https://c0deaddict.github.io/grunnjs-leds-2018/][slides]] are generated from [[./index.org][this]] Org file with [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal/][org-reveal]].  If you
want to do this yourself you need Emacs and install the org-reveal
package. Then open the =index.org= file and press =C-c C-e R R= this
will generate the =index.html= file.

In reveal.js press =s= to open the speaker notes.
